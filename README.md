A straightforward implementation of a blockchain in Golang. The project includes functionality for creating blocks, mining blocks using a proof-of-work mechanism, and maintaining the overall blockchain structure. The proof-of-work involves finding a nonce value that when combined with block data and the previous block hash, produces a hash with a specific leading pattern.

shows how to create a blockchain, add blocks to it, and print the details of each block. The Block struct represents an individual block in the blockchain, while the Blockchain struct manages the collection of blocks. The mining process involves finding a nonce value that results in a hash starting with "0000."
